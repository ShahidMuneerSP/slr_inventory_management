A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller/shop entity in connection with a transaction on the Platform.
How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?
Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller/shop entity. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.
It is important that before a Buyer/Seller/shop entity raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's/shop entity payment for that order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.
How is a 'dispute' created?

Disputes (Resolutions) Policy
Overview
Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Slrshoppee. However there may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers/shop entity may face issues. At Slrshoppee, we have a Dispute Resolution process in order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers/shop entity.
What is a 'dispute'?
A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller/shop entity in connection with a transaction on the Platform.
How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?
Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller/shop entity. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.
It is important that before a Buyer/Seller/shop entity raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's/shop entity payment for that order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.
How is a 'dispute' created?
Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can contact us through this link https://www.slrshoppee.com/helpcentre, while the Seller can write to ss@slrshoppee.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.

12.	Part/Accessory missing
13.	Item not Compatible
14.	Seller Description/Specification Wrong
15.	Defective (Functional issues)
16.	Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid Invoice
In case the Seller/shop entity rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a dispute, then Slrshoppee will try to mediate and resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is resolved in favour of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the product is returned to the Seller/shop entity. If the dispute is settled in favour of the Seller/shop entity, Buyer is entitled to any refund.
Buyer Protection Program
In case of a dispute where the Seller/shop entity is unable to provide a refund or a replacement, Slrshoppee will actively work towards reaching a resolution.
The Buyer Protection Program covers Buyers who are unable to successfully resolve their dispute with the Seller/shop entity or are not satisfied the resolution provided by the Seller.

Only after verifying these facts, a dispute can be registered.
